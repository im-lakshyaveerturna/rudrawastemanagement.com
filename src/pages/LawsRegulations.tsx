          <div className="commitment-content">
            <p>
              Under sections 6, 8, and 25 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the Central Government enacted the Biomedical Waste (Management & Handling) Rules to safeguard the public and healthcare workers from risks arising due to biomedical waste. Penalties align with those under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
            </p>
            <p>
              Delhi hospitals alone produce more than 30 tonnes of biomedical waste every day, yet satisfactory management remains a challenge (CPCB, 2001). Centralized facilities help authorities monitor and maintain compliance more effectively.
